Instructions
=============

This example was built with a combination of vagrant and various puppet modules.

To start the VM, navigate into the root of the checkout folder and type:

```bash
vagrant up
```

Give the VM a few minutes to provision itself. Once the process is complete, navigate to the following url to view a "Hello, world!" page:
